# weekly-business-review
Meeting template for a Weekly Business Review. I use this with my cofounders at [incident.io](https://incident.io) for our Weekly Business Review, 7:30AM on a Monday morning.

Tips on running it effectively:

* Prepare beforehand. We create a Notion document with the template, and fill it out on the Friday before the meeting.
* Run it the natural cycle of your company begins. For us, that's a Monday morning. This meeting is great to get everyone on the same page, and make tactical changes — doing at the start of a cycle works best for that.
* Pick up longer-term changes and discussions in a separate meeting. Don't try and squeeze quarterly planning into this. Keep it tactical and focused. It's fine to end early.

Hope you enjoy!

*Information broadcasts. Should not require much/any discussion. For example, “I’m having a hard conversation with X this week”, or “please make space in calendar to visit offices”. Fine to not have any.*
